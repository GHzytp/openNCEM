# ncempy.algo

The `ncempy.algo` module contains the algorithms used for the various image processing, data evaluating and simulating tasks. These are to be reused for different evaluations and are therefore written in a general way.
The evaluation targeting a certain problem is supposed to go in `ncempy.eval` and import all the necessary algorithms from `ncempy.algo`.
